## Getting Started (macOS)

Run the following terminal commands to set up your Mac for development.

Install Homebrew, a package manager for macOS which is needed to configure your computer with the necessary development tools:

```console
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Under the header "Next Steps", Homebrew may prompt you to run commands to complete the installation.

Install dependencies and The Rust Programming Language:

```console
brew install rustup osx-cross/arm/arm-gcc-bin purduesigbots/pros/pros-cli

rustup-init -y --default-toolchain nightly
```

Close and reopen the terminal, and install pros-rs:

```console
rustup component add rust-src
cargo install cargo-pros
```

## Getting Started (Windows)

Install Rust by following the instructions on <https://rustup.rs/>. Configure your installation when prompted, installing a **nightly** toolchain and keeping other default values.

Download and run the [ARM EABI Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-gnu-toolchain-downloads) installer, choosing the first `.exe` file under the header `arm-none-eabi`.

Install Python from <https://python.org/>.

Run the following commands in Powershell to install pros-rs:

```
python3 -m pip install --user pros-cli
rustup component add rust-src
cargo install cargo-pros
```

## Getting Started (Fedora Linux)

Run the following terminal commands to install dependencies and set up your PC for development.

```console
sudo dnf install rustup python3-pip arm-none-eabi-gcc-cs gcc

rustup-init -y --default-toolchain nightly
pip install --user pros-cli
```

Close and reopen the terminal, and install pros-rs:

```console
rustup component add rust-src
cargo install cargo-pros
```

## Compiling and uploading to a VEX V5 robot

Use the Cargo PROS terminal utility to compile this pros-rs project.

```console
cargo pros build
```

The separate `pros` command is used to upload. Plug in your VEX robot brain via USB and run the following command to upload to program slot 1:

```console
pros upload --target v5 --slot 1 ./target/armv7a-vexos-eabi/debug/pros-template-rust.bin
```

## Debugging in the pros-rs simulator

If you have PROS Simulator installed, you can use it to run this project without real VEX hardware for debugging and development purposes. Start by adding the WebAssembly Rust target:

```console
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

Build the project for the simulator by running:

```console
cargo pros build -s
```

Then open this project in PROS Simulator to run and debug the robot code.
